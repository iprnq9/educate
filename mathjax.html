<p>Formal Definition of the Derivative<br>

<p>Goal: Use the slope formula $m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ and a limit to derive the formal definition of a derivative.

<p>Recall that the derivative $f'(x)$ is simply a function that represents the slope of $f(x)$ at any given value of $x$.

<p>Also, recall that the slope between two points that lie on a curve $f(x)$, is:
$$slope = \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{rise}{run}$$

<p>We can derive the derivative (haha see what I did there?) by bringing those two points infinitely close together. Notice how as the two points get closer and closer together (as $\Delta x$ goes to $0$), the line between the two points is becoming a better and better representation of the tangent line.

<p>Now that we know what our goal is and that we can visualize our goal, let's put it in math terms. 
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="derivative_slope.png" /></p>

<p>If we want to find the slope from point $P$ to point $Q$, we can use the following formula, where $m_{PQ}$ is that slope.
$$m_{PQ} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{x+\Delta x - x} = \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
</p>

<p>Remember that the derivative is the tangent line slope at a single point. We have the slope between two points - how do we find the slope at the single point $P$? We take it to the limit!</p>
$$m_{PQ} = \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
$$f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

<p>Wait...so what'd I just do there? I used the limit to bring my two points infinitely close together by driving their separation ($\Delta x$) to $0$.

<p>That's the entire proof for the formal/limit definition of the derivative!
$$f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
